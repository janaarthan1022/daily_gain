Content negotiation is getting the response in different formats, example xml.

  Use this dependency:
<dependency>
			<groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat</groupId>
			<artifactId>jackson-dataformat-xml</artifactId>
</dependency>

  In the postman or Talend API tester, use Accept: application/xml as header and hit get request. We will get the response in xml
